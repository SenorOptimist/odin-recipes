<p>Made-from-scratch vanilla ice cream is a real treat, and it can be the base for many delicious frozen desserts. 
    This easy vanilla ice-cream recipe doesnâ€™t require eggs or cooking, so it comes together quickly. </p>

<p>With normal ice-cream recipes, you want to refrigerate your mixture before putting it in the ice-cream freezer. 
    However, since this is a no-cook recipe, the milk and cream should still be plenty cold. If you store the bowl of 
    your ice-cream maker in the freezer, you can have great homemade vanilla ice cream in about 15 minutes. Keep in mind, however, 
    that your machine may require that the finished ice cream is frozen for a while after churning. While that may delay your homemade treat a bit, 
    the ease of preparing this recipe is still worth it.</p>
